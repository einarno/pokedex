# Go Pokémon CLI

A simple Go-based Command Line Interface (CLI) that interacts with the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to retrieve and display information about Pokémon. This project serves as a playground for experimenting with building a basic Text-based User Interface (TUI) in Go without any third-party libraries.

## Features

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.16 or higher.
- Internet connection (for accessing the PokéAPI).

2. Build the CLI:
